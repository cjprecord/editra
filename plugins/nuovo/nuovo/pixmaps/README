NOTE for 0.4:

This release includes some PNG icons for evolution stock icons.
It seems that evolution isn't loading ANY of the SVG stock icons, so
you can find the PNGs in 24x24/stock/evolution
those same icons are available in scalable/stock for you to modify
sorry for choosing this way, but is the only one i've found so far.

you can also find icons for GNOME Baker in Xtra directory, along
with instructions on how to install them. some icons for iRiver devices
IHP-120, IPF-880 and H10 to replace 'gnome-dev-ipod'.

*** Mozilla Firefox Theme ***

yes, a theme for Mozilla Firefox is available :), you can get it at

http://www.droplinegnome.org/home/ertz/ARTWork/firefox

it isn't included in this package for the simple reason that this is
a GNOME icon set, so i'm trying not to get too off-topic...
this is my first firefox theme, so be gentle, heh.
