This is not out of greeve, it's just that i have lots of school work to do, and 'a little something'
would be appreciated to have some motivation (other that the plain enjoyment).
I'd like to have some drawing tools, such as a tablet and some financial resources to pay some bills ;)

Anyway, is up to you to donate. If you like my work and you really enjoy using it, then i think
it would be a nice thing to do.
