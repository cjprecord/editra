I hope to make this editor accessible to as many people as possible and part of that is providing the editor in as many localized languages as possible. I am currently looking some people that are willing to do some additional translations for the editor. The editor is currently available in English and Japanese.

Translations are handled by the gettext system using .po files. If you are interested in providing a translation or even partial translation the template file can be found at (http://editra.org/uploads/lang/messages.pot). If you are interested or require more information please feel free to contact me (cprecord@editra.org).

I have also recently registered the project at http://launchpad.net but have been waiting a few days for the language files I uploaded to get approved. Hopefully that will get taken care of sometime soon as it will be much easier to collaborate on the development of the language files then.
